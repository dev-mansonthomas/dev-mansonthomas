# 👋 Hello, I'm Thomas Manson

## 🚀 About Me

I am a Sales Engineer and tech enthusiast with extensive experience in software solutions, technical architecture, and pre-sales activities. I have a strong background in integrating and demonstrating complex technologies, and I am particularly interested in the rapidly growing field of Artificial Intelligence.

On my spare time, I'm volunteering for the French Red Cross as paramedics/ambulance driver 🚑 and software developer. I'm developping theses projects to contribute to helping others. It's also an opportunity to experiment new technologies, that I'm then using in my professionnal projects. 

Mid 2024, I've completed a 10 weeks on site training on [Datascience and AI](https://www.lewagon.com/fr/data-science-course) with <img src="images/lewagon.jpg" alt="Le Wagon" width="16" height="16"> Le Wagon : Mathematics, Statistics, Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and most importantly, the methodology to clean, scale, equilibrate the data, split the data to avoid data leakage, choose the right model, evaluate and increase its performances
